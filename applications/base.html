    The area before the START: Embeddable is used to make the
    project act as much like the MinnPost site as possible
    to ensure best quality and ease of local development.
    
    The following links are to cached collections of
    CSS and JS and will change when the cache is cleared on
    the site.
    
    So, if your links are NOT MinnPost red, then you'll probably
    have to update this.

    <!-- 
      Include Javascript libraries here.
      
      jQuery 1.3.2 is included to best mimic the MinnPost site.
      Unfortunately we don't have much control over the jQuery version
      or anyway to keep it contained.  This means that we use a
      version of jQuery that has been renamed to jQueryCustom.
      It's annoying but ensures that there are no JS errors on the
      page that can cause all types of different problems,
      while being able to use a newer version of jQuery.
      
      See: https://github.com/MinnPost/jquery-custom
      
      JS and other relevant libraries are hosted on our
      AWS S3 account.  This ensures we do not have to
      embed them or otherwise manage them on the MinnPost
      site which would be a pain.  We can also leverage
      using the same source across projects.
      
      You are welcome to use hosted/CDN versions of
      libraries, but do ensure you are using a specific
      version.  DO NOT use the latest, or latest-stable,
      or development versions of hosted libraries
      as they are subject to change and will eventutally
      break, creating more work for us.
